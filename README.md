  <summary><h3>üíª Somaro's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My coding journey began in high school when I joined a robotics team and started learning Arduino. I quickly fell in love with creating and programming robots to compete against other teams in province-wide competitions. There's nothing quite like the rush of seeing your hard work pay off in a team-oriented setting.

  After high school, I went to college and pursued a degree in business. But as much as I enjoyed the classes, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. Eventually, I realized that my true passion still lay in coding, and I knew that I wanted to explore the world of Full-Stack web development. I began taking courses and diving into different projects, eager to learn as much as I could about web development.

  Now, with a wealth of knowledge and experience under my belt, I'm thrilled to be pursuing a career in Full-Stack Web Development. I'm a playful person at heart, and I bring a business-casual attitude to everything I do. I'm easy to work with and love collaborating with others to create beautiful and functional web applications.

  My coding journey has taught me the importance of perseverance and determination in pursuing my passions. I'm excited to take on new challenges in the field of web development, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next.
